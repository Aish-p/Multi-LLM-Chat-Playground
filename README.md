# Multi-LLM-Chat-Playground

Welcome to the **Multi-LLM Chat Playground!** 🎉 This interactive app lets you compare responses from multiple **Large Language Models (LLMs)** in real-time using **LiteLLM** — a lightweight, unified API for interacting with different LLM providers.

✨ Supported Models
* **GPT-4o**
* **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**
* **Cohere Command R Plus**

Whether you’re experimenting with **creative prompts** or exploring the models' different styles, this app provides a fun, easy way to see how each model handles the same input.

## Key Features
🤖 **Multi-Model Comparison:** Compare responses from GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Cohere Command R Plus.

🔧 **Custom Prompts:** Define your own prompts to influence model behavior and responses.

👀 **Side-by-Side View:** Instantly see how each model interprets and responds to the same input.

🔌 **Powered by LiteLLM:** A simple, unified interface to access multiple LLMs with ease.

🎨 **Creative Experimentation:** Test various prompts, from simple questions to creative tasks like writing poetry.

## How It Works

   Provide API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere to access the models.

2. **Test Your Prompts** ✍️
   
   Enter a custom prompt or use the default one to see how it shapes the models' responses.

3. **Enter Your Message** 💬
